# tsainez.github.io

Experimental playground for my personal website. Not intended to be super professional per-se, but rather an outlet for personal expression. 🤷‍♀️

For instance, if you follow the updates of this repository, you'll find:

- Snapshots of my site over time as I have gone through different technologies such as static site generators (e.g. Jekyll) or techniques.
- Personal obsessions over time, such as complicated systems like linguistics or robotics, or other interdisciplinary things.
- Technical guides that I have left over for myself, however readable or not. All in the hope that I would eventually come back to this when time permits!

## 💥 Quickstart

- To start this website:

      bundle exec jekyll serve

## 📚 Requirements

1. Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher, including all development headers (check your Ruby version using `ruby -v`)
2. RubyGems (check your Gems version using `gem -v`)
3. GCC and Make (check versions using `gcc -v`, `g++ -v`, and `make -v`)
4. Jekyll and bundler gems (install using `gem install jekyll bundler`)
