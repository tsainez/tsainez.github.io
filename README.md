# tsainez.github.io

Experimental playground for my personal website. Not intended to be super professional per-se, but rather an outlet for personal expression. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

For instance, if you follow the updates of this repository, you'll find:

- Snapshots of my site over time as I have gone through different technologies such as static site generators (e.g. Jekyll) or techniques.
- Personal obsessions over time, such as complicated systems like linguistics or robotics, or other interdisciplinary things.
- Technical guides that I have left over for myself, however readable or not. All in the hope that I would eventually come back to this when time permits!

## üí• Quickstart

- To start this website:

      bundle exec jekyll serve

## üìö Requirements

1. Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher, including all development headers (check your Ruby version using `ruby -v`)
2. RubyGems (check your Gems version using `gem -v`)
3. GCC and Make (check versions using `gcc -v`, `g++ -v`, and `make -v`)
4. Jekyll and bundler gems (install using `gem install jekyll bundler`)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Switch from Jekyll to Next.js

Switching from Jekyll to Next.js for this statically generated site will prove useful for several reasons:

1. A large technology switch is also an ideal opportunity to **overhaul the theme of the site** while simultaneously learning about new concepts.
2. Next.js is more **robust & future-proof** than Jekyll, though Jekyll is more advantageous in it's simplicity.
3. This new technology introduces the idea of **components** which when embraced will surely speed development in the right circumstances. Additionally, I will have to start using **React**.

Some **difficulties** might include:

1. Complexity especially starting out, and then with regards to **no native GitHub Pages** support. For this, I might have to create a CI/CD pipeline through **GitHub Actions**.
2. Learning **[JavaScript](https://nextjs.org/learn)**.
